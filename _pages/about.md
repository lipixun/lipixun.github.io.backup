Hi, My name's Simon Li (Lipixun) and I live in the Beijing China. Thanks for visiting my site.

I'm a software engineer and especially interested in backend service architecting / large distributed system architecting and machine learning algorithms.

I'm now forcing on these domains:

- Kubernetes and related distributed container infrastructure solutions
- Service Mesh
- Machine learning (Especially deep learning) and tensorflow
- Recommendation algorithm & system
